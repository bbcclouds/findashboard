**No accounts. No tracking. No subscriptions.**  
Local-only Windows app that helps you track net worth, accounts, debts, and investments.

Welcome to Fin Dashboard!

Getting Started: A Quick Tour
Add Accounts: Navigate to the Accounts page to add your checking, savings, or other bank accounts. This is the foundation of your financial picture.
Track Income: Go to the Income page to define your income sources (like 'Salary') and then log your earnings as they come in.
List Liabilities: Use the Debts and Credit Cards pages to log any loans, recurring commitments, or credit card balances.
Add Assets: Catalog your investments on the Stocks, Crypto, Retirement, Home, and Other Assets pages.
Watch it Come Together: Return to the Dashboard to see a complete overview of your net worth and financial health.
Key Features by Page
Dashboard
Your central hub. Get a high-level view of your Net Worth, Total Assets, and Total Liabilities. See your performance over time and your asset allocation at a glance.

Accounts & Credit Cards
Manage bank and credit card accounts. Log transactions, create sub-accounts for budgeting (e.g., "Vacation Fund"), and manage spending categories. View detailed transaction histories for each account.

Debts & Home
Track all your liabilities, from formal loans (mortgages, car loans) to informal commitments. The Home page specifically helps you track your real estate equity, mortgage details, and home improvement investments.

Investments (Stocks, Crypto, Retirement)
Log all your investment holdings. Update their prices periodically to keep your net worth accurate. The Retirement page allows you to track contributions and see portfolio growth separately.

Calculator & Forecasting
The Calculator is a powerful budgeting tool to allocate your income. The Forecasting tool projects your future cash flow based on recurring income and expenses you define, helping you anticipate financial highs and lows.

Settings
Customize your app name, set a password for privacy, and manage your data. Here you can create a full backup of your data or restore from a backup file. You can also export specific data sets (like transactions) to a CSV file.

Tips for Best Use
Update Regularly: For the most accurate net worth, update the prices of your stocks, crypto, and other assets weekly or monthly.
Use Sub-Accounts: The sub-account feature on the Accounts page is great for "envelope" style budgeting. Create sub-accounts for specific goals like 'Emergency Fund' or 'New Car'.
Backup Your Data: Since all data is local, it's crucial to use the Backup feature in Settings regularly. Save the backup file in a safe place.
Explore "What-If": The Forecasting page has a "What-If" scenario planner. Use it to see how a large purchase or a bonus might impact your future cash flow without affecting yourÂ actualÂ data.
